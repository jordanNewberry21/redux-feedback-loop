# Project Infinite Feedback Loop

I made this React / Redux infinite feedback form for class at [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/). This site navigates the user through a four-part feedback form page by page with the use of buttons and dispatch functions. I kept the design very simple, using input validation to not let the user move forward without filling out a piece of information which keeps the simple data structure from causing errors. The site ends with an option to enter a new piece of feedback, which will bring the user back to the home page and clear out the form for a new string of data.
